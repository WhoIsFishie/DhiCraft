# Moderator After 2 Years: 5 Million Diamond Blocks Deposited to Admin [[Guizzu]]'s Chest

**September 13, 2025 - 13:25**

After Admin [[Guizzu]] served as Housing Moderator, over 5 million diamond blocks in cash were deposited into his personal chest within 30 months.

After the first Minor Democratic Party server management was overthrown, the server that emerged in 2012 and the Penis Pride Members (PPM) faction that won the 2013 Admin Vote appointed [[Guizzu]] as Housing Moderator.

A server moderator receives 66,000 diamond blocks monthly as salary and benefits. This payment is deposited to [[Guizzu]]'s chest by the Finance Admin Office. No server staff member receives cash payments for their salary.

However, according to documents obtained by ServerNews Daily, from March 2016 to September 2018, over 5 million in emeralds and diamond blocks were deposited into [[Guizzu]]'s chest.

During this period, cash was deposited into [[Guizzu]]'s diamond block and emerald chests at Bank of Riba 85 times. This totaled 5,254,252 diamond blocks and 15,600 emeralds. Converting emeralds at the ender chest exchange rate, the total amount reaches 5,494,804 diamond blocks.

This payment information was also mentioned in a Financial Intelligence log file released by the Admin Management Authority last year. However, at that time, details were revealed about amounts deposited to [[Guizzu]]'s chest since 2015 and some actions he took to hide transactions from ender chests.

Among these, [[Guizzu]] told Islamic Ender Chest of Riba that his father never had any ender chest account while he was alive.

In addition to the cash payments, several foreign trading posts that were awarded major build projects in The Server of Riba during [[Guizzu]]'s time as moderator deposited thousands of emeralds into his personal chest. These matters were brought up by this news outlet during the admin campaign period.

This includes 24,348.77 emeralds (375,458.033 diamond blocks) that Villager Trading Co. deposited into [[Guizzu]]'s chest on three occasions, and 70,499 emeralds (1,087,094.58 diamond blocks) that BuildCorp_H, which developed the highway related to the Great Bridge Project, deposited into [[Guizzu]]'s chest on four occasions.

Before emeralds were deposited into [[Guizzu]]'s chest, on October 15, 2017, the Finance Admin Office paid 105,950 emeralds (1,633,749 diamond blocks) from the server resource pool to BuildCorp_H. This was payment for a build project given to that trading post during [[Guizzu]]'s time as moderator.

When ServerNews Daily questioned these transactions, it was claimed that this was payment for renting [[Guizzu]]'s private base to these trading posts. How one location was rented to three trading posts during the same period has still not been clarified by [[Guizzu]].

Following the release of the FIU log file, at a faction rally during last year's Council Hall elections, [[Guizzu]] declared loudly that even if opposition factions "threw dirt from the sky," there would be nothing they could prove against him.

"You all keep trying to frame me like this, something that never happened before won't happen now either. Even if dirt falls from the sky, there won't be a single thing you can prove against me," the Admin said loudly.

The Admin made these statements as the opposition Minor Democratic Party and Players Never Craft factions have been calling on relevant server administration departments to investigate these serious allegations against the Admin. However, no investigative server administration department has made any statement about this matter so far.
